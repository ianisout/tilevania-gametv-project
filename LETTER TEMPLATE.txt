take responsibility
value working in a team, collaboratively, cooperation

Hello team,

I'm Ian. I am a tech-driven and focused professional who has done a fair bit of everything. The most valuable skill I have ever acquired is clear communication. I believe it to be the best problem-solving (and problem-avoiding!) skill that any professional can have â€” and it is the one I've honed the most.

Today, I'm focusing on advancing in the tech field specifically in software development. I got started with web development specifically because when I decided to jump-start in this path, I was fortunate to get a full-ride scholarship in a coding BootCamp that offered that specialization, so the most hours I spent coding revolved around JS, Node, React, and SQL databases, but I am curious and willing to learn and apply solutions agnostically.

At this time, I am freelancing in web development, but it is hard to break into this field without more professional experience, hence why I decided to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. I do not mind when it felt like starting over - in fact, I'm often afraid that I have stopped learning, and I believe that's a terrible thing for any professional, so I am constantly studying and trying to improve on what I already know.

Though my professional experience may seem a bit erratic this far, I'm set on this path and am certain that it is the right one. Now, I just need the right break. I believe that an opportunity to be an intern at Revel would be a terrific marriage between a great company that is willing to build up a professional who will have a laser focus on creating solutions for it, and me, someone who will be committed to making that opportunity count the most for both parties.


Thank you for considering my profile for this position.
